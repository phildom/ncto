A note for Linux and Mac users:
If ksh is not available on your system, just change the hashbang [0]
to /bin/bash or wherever your bash is hiding. Worked on Ubuntu 10.04
and Debian Squeeze 6.0.  However, Mac OS X's bash has problems
interpreting the pattern in the [[ expression ]] command.
Just stay with its ksh.
